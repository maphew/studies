# studies
[Leo][0] files dedicated to studying other project's source code.

They allow me to examine and make changes to other code repositories in place without messing those other repos up or getting in the way of their authors. You're welcome to use what you find here, but the notes and code will be personal and highly idiosyncratic; don't expect anything to just work. ;-)
